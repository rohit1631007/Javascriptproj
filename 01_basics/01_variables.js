//Prefer not to use var because it have issue with block scope and functional Scope.//
//var	Function-scoped
//let	Block-scoped ({})
//const	Block-scoped ({})
//var is visible throughout the function in which it is declared.

//let and const are only visible within the block {} where they are declared.
